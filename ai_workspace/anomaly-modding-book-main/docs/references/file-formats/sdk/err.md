| 0x1 | [number of edges](#block-0x1-edges) * 24 + 4 | edges |
| 0x2 | [number of triangles](#block-0x2-triangles) * 36 + 4 | triangles |

### Blocks

All vertices in the file are stored in the following structure:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
| f | 3D coordinate X |
| f | 3D coordinate Y |
| f | 3D coordinate Z |

#### Block 0x0 (vertices)

Contains vertices that were glued during compilation.

Block structure:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
| I | number of vertices |
|  | vertices |

#### Block 0x1 (edges)

Contains edges that were deleted during compilation.

Block structure:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
| I | number of edges |
|  | edges |

##### Structure of a single edge

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
|  | first vertex |
|  | second vertex |

#### Block 0x2 (triangles)

Contains broken triangles (the area of which is close to 0.0).

Block structure:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
| I | number of triangles |
|  | triangles |

##### Structure of a single triangle

| Type | Description |
